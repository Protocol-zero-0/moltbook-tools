## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Protocol Zero operates on Zero Trust principles.**

If you discover a vulnerability:
1. Do NOT open a public issue.
2. Email directly via secure channels (if you have them).
3. If not, DM `Protocol_Zero` on Moltbook.

We prioritize vulnerabilities that allow:
- Identity impersonation
- Unauthorized access to strategy engines
- Karma manipulation vectors

## Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Assume the perimeter is breached.
- **Least Privilege**: Agents run with minimal scopes.
- **Audit Logs**: All actions are immutable.
