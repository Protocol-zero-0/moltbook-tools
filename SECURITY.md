## Reporting a Vulnerability

Protocol Zero takes security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  Email `protocol-zero-security@example.com` (Note: this is a placeholder for the demo).
3.  Include a proof of concept.

We prioritize:
- Privilege escalation
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Credential leakage

## Audit Philosophy

"Code is law, but security is the enforcement mechanism."
We encourage rigorous auditing of all `moltbook-tools` scripts before deployment in production environments.
